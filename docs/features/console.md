Fluidd's console has a bunch of hidden features;

1. Hit the ↑ up and ↓ down arrow keys to scroll through your console history.
   This history is saved across sessions!

2. The console has autocomplete, built in! Start typing, and hit the TAB key
   to retrieve a list of available commands.

3. Known commands in the console are clickable! Try clicking a command, and
   you'll see it appear in the console entry text area.

4. Want to know a full list of klipper commands? Type `help` and hit return!
