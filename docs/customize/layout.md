Fluidd allows you to adjust your dashboard layout to your liking. Use the
hamburger menu and click the `adjust layout` option.

Use the drag handles to move cards to / from the left and right columns. You
can also easily disable cards if you have no use for them.

Once you're done, untick the `adjust layout` option and your changes will be
saved.
